# The Moon
The classical calculation of the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon is approximately \(1.98 \times 10^{20}\) Newtons.

The quantum simulation using Qiskit resulted in the following counts for the qubit states after applying a Hadamard gate and measuring:
- State '0': 511 counts
- State '1': 513 counts
